      name: Light in the Real World
      description: Light emits photons that travel in straight lines until they hit
        an object. These photons may be absorbed, reflected or pass through an object.
        Some photons will find its way back to an eye/camera where they are processed
        into an image.

    - identifier: 
      name: Ray Tracing
      description: In ray tracing, this process is simulated. However, instead of
        tacing rays (photons) from the light source, the rays are traced backwards
        from the eye/camera to the light source. This still creates realistic images
        but is much faster.

      name: Shininess
      description: The shininess of this wall is set to 128. This value describes
        the size/smoothness of the specular highlights. So, the wall here has very
        small specular highlights. Change the shininess and notice how the specular
        highlights change in size.
